<h1><u>OSINTForge's Reverse DNS Lookup Tool</u></h1>


This module performs a reverse DNS lookup for a given IP address to retrieve the associated hostname and related IPs.

How it works:

Run the Reverse DNS Lookup module with:
python osintforge.py -m reverse_dns -t <target_ip>

Parameters
	•	-m reverse_dns: Specifies the module to run.
	•	-t <target_ip>: The IP address to perform the reverse lookup on.

Examples

Reverse DNS Lookup for an IP Address
python osintforge.py -m reverse_dns -t 8.8.8.8

Sample Output:
Performing reverse DNS lookup for: 8.8.8.8

Reverse DNS Lookup Results:
IP Address: 8.8.8.8
Hostname: dns.google
Associated IPs: 8.8.8.8

Error Handling

If the lookup fails, the module will return an error message:
Performing reverse DNS lookup for: 192.168.0.1

Error: Reverse DNS lookup failed: [Errno 1] Unknown host

Notes

1.	Supported Targets:
	•	The target must be a valid IP address.
	•	Private or non-routable IPs (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x) may not resolve to a hostname.
2.	Use Cases:
	•	Identifying the hostname associated with an IP address.
	•	Verifying the domain of a public-facing server.
3.	Limitations:
	•	Some IPs may not have PTR records, resulting in an “Unknown host” error.
	•	IPv6 support is dependent on the system’s DNS configuration.

Future Enhancements

1.	Batch Mode:
	•	Allow multiple IPs to be processed in a single run.
2.	Export Results:
	•	Save lookup results to a file (e.g., JSON, CSV).
3.	IPv6 Compatibility:
	•	Extend functionality to support IPv6 addresses.
