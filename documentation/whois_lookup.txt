<h1><u>OSINTForge's WHOIS Lookup Tool</u></h1>

How It Works

1.	Input:
	•	The tool accepts a domain name (e.g., example.com) as the target.
	•	Example command:

python osintforge.py -m whois_lookup -t example.com


2.	Processing:
	•	The tool uses the python-whois library to query WHOIS records for the given domain.
	•	It fetches registration details from the WHOIS database, including:
	•	Domain name.
	•	Registrar information.
	•	Creation and expiration dates.
	•	Name servers.
	•	Status (e.g., active, expired).
3.	Output:
	•	The WHOIS record is displayed in the terminal in a readable format.
4.	Error Handling:
	•	If the domain is invalid or no WHOIS record is found, the tool displays an error message.

Steps to Use

1.	Run the Tool:
	•	Command:
python osintforge.py -m whois_lookup -t example.com

2.	Example Output:
Performing WHOIS Lookup for: example.com

WHOIS Lookup Results:

Domain Name: example.com
Registrar: VeriSign Global Registry Services
WHOIS Server: whois.verisign-grs.com
Creation Date: 1995-08-14
Expiration Date: 2025-08-14
Status: active
Name Servers: a.iana-servers.net, b.iana-servers.net


3.	For Invalid Domains:
	•	Example Command:
python osintforge.py -m whois_lookup -t invalid_domain

	•	Expected Output:
Error during WHOIS lookup: No WHOIS data found for invalid_domain


Key Features

1.	Registration Details:
	•	Retrieve important domain ownership information, including registrar and dates.
2.	Name Servers:
	•	Identify the DNS servers responsible for the domain.
3.	Domain Status:
	•	Check if the domain is active, on hold, or expired.
4.	Error Handling:
	•	Handles invalid domains gracefully.

Common Use Cases

1.	Investigating Domains:
	•	Understand who owns a suspicious domain or when it was registered.
2.	Checking Domain Expiration:
	•	Find when a domain expires to assess its current status.
3.	OSINT Investigations:
	•	Use WHOIS data to cross-reference with other tools (e.g., DNS lookup, IP geolocation).

Limitations

1.	Privacy Protection:
	•	Many registrars anonymize WHOIS records using privacy protection services, so owner details may not be available.
2.	Rate Limiting:
	•	Excessive queries to the WHOIS servers might trigger rate limits.

Enhancements to Consider

1.	Reverse WHOIS Lookup:
	•	Use a paid service (e.g., WhoisXML API) to find other domains registered by the same owner.
2.	Batch Mode:
	•	Accept a list of domains for bulk WHOIS lookups.
3.	Data Export:
	•	Save WHOIS records to a CSV or JSON file for further analysis.
