<h1><u>OSINTForge's Hidden Directory Scanning Tool</u></h1>

Directory Scanner Module

Description:

The Directory Scanner module attempts to find hidden or unlisted directories on a target website by brute-forcing paths from a predefined wordlist. It provides the HTTP status code for each discovered directory, helping identify accessible resources or misconfigured endpoints.

Usage:

1.	Run the Module:
Use the following command:

python osintforge.py -m directory_scanner -t <target_url>

Replace <target_url> with the URL of the target website.
Example:

python osintforge.py -m directory_scanner -t https://example.com


2.	Expected Output:
The module will list each scanned directory along with its HTTP status code and status description.
Example Output:

Scanning directories on: https://example.com/

https://example.com/admin/ - 403 Forbidden
https://example.com/login/ - 200 OK
Response Content (first 200 chars of body text):
"Welcome to the Login Page
Please enter your credentials..."

https://example.com/dashboard/ - 404 Not Found
https://example.com/config/ - 403 Forbidden
https://example.com/test/ - 200 OK
Response body Content (first 200 chars of body text):
"Skip to main contentServer Error 500This system
is currently offline for maintenance.Please try later..."



Common Use Cases:

1.	Identify Hidden Resources:
	•	Find unlisted directories that may contain sensitive information (e.g., /admin/, /backup/).
2.	Test Web Security:
	•	Discover misconfigured endpoints or directories with improper access controls.
3.	Reconnaissance:
	•	Map the structure of a target web server as part of an OSINT or penetration testing engagement.

Error Handling:

	•	Connection Errors:

Error accessing https://example.com/admin/: Connection error. Is the domain correct?

	•	Solution: Verify the target URL and your internet connection.

	•	HTTP 404 Responses:

https://example.com/test/ - 404 Not Found

	•	Indicates that the requested directory does not exist on the server.

Notes:

	•	Ensure you have permission to scan the target website and comply with its terms of service.
	•	The included wordlist is limited to common directory names but can be expanded for more exhaustive scanning.

Enhancements for Future Use:

	•	Allow users to specify a custom wordlist.
	•	Add support for multithreading to speed up scans.
	•	Optionally save results to a file for later analysis.
