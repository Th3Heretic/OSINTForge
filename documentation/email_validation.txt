<h1><u>OSINTForge's Email Validation Tool</u></h1>

Email Address Validation Module

Description:

The Email Address Validation module verifies whether an email address is correctly formatted and potentially deliverable. It performs two key checks:

	1.	Syntax Validation: Ensures the email address is in a valid format.
	2.	Domain Validation: Confirms the email domain has valid MX records, indicating it can receive emails.

Usage:

	1.	Run the Module:
Use the following command:

python osintforge.py -m email_validation -t <email_address>

Replace <email_address> with the email you want to validate.
Example:

python osintforge.py -m email_validation -t test@example.com


	2.	Expected Output:
	•	For a valid email address with deliverable domain:

Validating email address: test@example.com
The domain 'example.com' has valid MX records.
Email address appears deliverable.


	•	For an invalid email format:

Validating email address: invalid_email
Error: Invalid email format.


	•	For a non-deliverable email:

Validating email address: fake@example.com
The domain 'example.com' does not have valid MX records.
Email address is not deliverable.



Common Use Cases:

	1.	Investigating Suspicious Emails:
	•	Determine if an email address is legitimate or potentially fake.
	2.	Contact Verification:
	•	Check if a contact’s email address is active and deliverable.
	3.	Pre-Sending Validation:
	•	Validate email addresses before using them in campaigns or outreach efforts.

Error Handling:

	•	If the domain does not exist or has no DNS records:

The domain 'nonexistent.com' does not have valid MX records.
Email address is not deliverable.


	•	For network issues or timeouts:

Error during email validation: [Error details]



Notes:

	•	This module performs DNS-based checks only; it does not send emails.
	•	Ensure you have a stable internet connection for accurate DNS resolution.
