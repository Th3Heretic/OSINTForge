<h1><u>OSINTForge's Metadata Extraction Tool</u></h1>

How It Works

1.	Input:
	•	You provide the tool with a target file (e.g., an image, PDF, or document).
	•	The file path should be valid and accessible (e.g., /path/to/file.jpg).
2.	Processing:
	•	The tool uses ExifTool (via a subprocess call) to extract metadata.
	•	Metadata includes information such as:
	•	File type: File format and MIME type.
	•	Timestamps: Creation, modification, or access dates.
	•	Camera/Device details: For images, details like camera make, model, and lens used.
	•	GPS coordinates: For images with location data.
	•	Document properties: Author, title, and software used for PDFs or Office files.
3.	Output:
	•	The metadata is displayed in the terminal in a readable format.
4.	Error Handling:
	•	If the file is not found or ExifTool encounters an issue, the tool displays an error message.

Steps to Use

1.	Run the Tool:
	•	Example:
python osintforge.py -m metadata_extraction -t /absolute/path/to/file.jpg

2.	Output Example:
Extracting metadata from: /path/to/file.jpg

Metadata Extraction Results:

File Name: file.jpg
File Size: 2 MB
Creation Date: 2023-08-15 12:34:56
Camera: Canon EOS 80D
GPS Coordinates: 37.7749, -122.4194

	•	This data provides insights about the file’s origin, its content, and potentially its geographic source.

Common Use Cases

1.	Image Analysis:
	•	Extract GPS data to determine where a photo was taken.
	•	Analyze device info to identify the source of a photo.
2.	Document Investigation:
	•	Check the author and creation software for PDFs and Word files.
	•	Look for timestamps to understand a document’s history.
3.	Forensic Applications:
	•	Trace metadata to confirm authenticity or tampering.

Tips for Effective Use

	•	Use known files for testing to see what metadata is extracted.
	•	If analyzing sensitive files, remember metadata can sometimes reveal private or unnecessary details.
