<h1><u>OSINTForge's Subdomain Enumeration Tool</u></h1>

Enhancements for Consideration

1.	Wordlist-Based Enumeration:
	•	Use a wordlist (e.g., from SecLists) to brute-force subdomains.
2.	Batch Processing:
	•	Accept multiple domains for enumeration.
3.	Integration with Other APIs:
	•	Include additional services like Shodan or Censys for advanced subdomain discovery.
4.	Export Results:
	•	Save discovered subdomains to a file for further analysis.
