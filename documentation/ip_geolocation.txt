<h1><u>OSINTForge's IP Geolocation Tool</u></h1>

How It Works

1.	Input:
	•	You provide the tool with an IP address to locate.
	•	Example: 8.8.8.8 (Google’s public DNS server).
2.	Processing:
	•	The tool queries the ip-api.com service using the requests library.
	•	The API responds with geolocation data for the given IP address.
3.	Output:
	•	The tool prints the retrieved information in the terminal, including:
	•	IP Address: The queried IP.
	•	Country: Country of origin.
	•	Region: Region or state.
	•	City: City associated with the IP.
	•	ZIP Code: Postal/ZIP code (if available).
	•	ISP: Internet service provider.
	•	Coordinates: Latitude and longitude.
4.	Error Handling:
	•	If the input is invalid or the API fails, the tool displays an error message.

Steps to Use

1.	Run the Tool:
	•	Example Command:
python osintforge.py -m ip_geolocation -t 8.8.8.8

2.	Example Output:
Performing IP Geolocation for: 8.8.8.8

Geolocation Results:

IP Address: 8.8.8.8
Country: United States
Region: California
City: Mountain View
ZIP: 94043
ISP: Google LLC
Latitude: 37.4056, Longitude: -122.0775

3.	For Invalid IPs:
	•	Example Command:
python osintforge.py -m ip_geolocation -t 256.256.256.256

	•	Expected Output:
Error: Invalid IP address - 256.256.256.256

Key Features
1.	Validation:
	•	The tool validates the input to ensure it’s a proper IPv4 address before sending it to the API.
2.	Free API:
	•	The ip-api.com service is free and doesn’t require an API key for basic usage.
3.	Extensibility:
	•	The module can easily be extended to support batch processing or other geolocation APIs.

Common Use Cases
1.	Investigating Suspicious IPs:
	•	Find the geographical origin of an IP address to assess potential risks.
2.	OSINT Investigations:
	•	Cross-reference geolocation data with other OSINT findings.
3.	Network Analysis:
	•	Use it to map external connections to your network or server logs.

Enhancements to Consider

1.	Support Multiple APIs:
	•	Integrate additional APIs like ipinfo.io, ipstack, or MaxMind.
	•	Allow users to select the API via CLI flags (e.g., -a ipinfo).
2.	Batch Processing:
	•	Accept a list of IPs for bulk geolocation.
	•	Save results to a file for further analysis.
3.	Visualize Locations on a Map:
	•	Plot IP geolocations on a world map using libraries like folium or geopandas.
4.	ASN (Autonomous System Number) Lookup:
	•	Retrieve ASN data for the IP, including the organization and routing information.
5.	Advanced Error Handling:
	•	Add better messages for invalid IPs or API rate limits.
